# NAC-BL

This experiment deals with a WGCNA analysis of preNAC samples. We will investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with pCR.

It is very similar to the experiment in exp2019-04-16. But now we filter the sample by BC subtuype and analyse the Basal-like subtype.


In this case we are integrating WGCNA and DIAMOnD. We will find gene modules correlated with pCR and use these genes as seeds in DIAMOnD to capture more genes. Since our expression data comes from a limited panel (ca. 700 genes), we need to expand the set of genes we find correlated with pCR to have a broader picture of the biological processes and pathways that are implicated in pCR.

Update: There is no module correlated with ChemoRes or pCR. I will redirect the experiment to check pre NAC and post NAC samples of basal-like subtype. This way IÂ´ll get some insigth into the mechanims that underlies the changes caused by NAC
